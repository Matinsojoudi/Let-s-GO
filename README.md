# Let's GO 🚀

Welcome to my Go learning playground! 🧠💻

This repo is where I’m learning **Golang** by getting my hands dirty — one project at a time. No theory dumps, no boring tutorials. Just building stuff, breaking stuff, fixing stuff... and learning along the way.

## 🧩 What’s inside?

You'll find:
- ✨ Mini-projects that helped me understand Go
- 🛠️ Hands-on code with comments and notes
- 📚 Mistakes, fixes, and everything in between
- 💡 Ideas that *might* be useful to others too

## 🚶 Why this repo?

Because learning by doing is fun — and sharing it makes it even better!  
If you're also starting out with Go, maybe you'll find something helpful here. Or maybe you'll just laugh at my bugs 😅

## 🧠 Prerequisites

Just a basic knowledge of programming is enough. I’ll keep things beginner-friendly, promise.

## 🔄 Work in Progress

This repo will grow as I learn. More projects, more experiments, and probably more weird bugs 🐛
